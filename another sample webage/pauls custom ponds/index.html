        <h2><B>Making your property more waterful.</B></h2>
        <p>Paul has created lakes, rivers, and water structures to customer specifications. If you need a
            specific size and shape to fit your area, we will be happy to work with you to create exactly what you
            need. Paul will work with you to create your own one-of-a-kind water feature. You can select
            the coloration, size and shape. In addition, we can add other features you wonâ€™t find in the lakes
            available for immediate purchase. Features such as grasses, logs, and/or rocks along the shoreline. Need an
            island or peninsula? We can do that too! Please specify if you intend to use your lake or river outside. We
            use different base materials for outdoor use. If you do not specify, your lake will be constructed in our
            standard process and will not be suitable for outdoor applications. Please contact us for more information,
            to provide us with the details, and recieve a quote. Please visit our google+ and facebook pages to view
            more photos of custom lakes produced by Paul</p>
