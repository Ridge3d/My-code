You can achieve this using Python with the `pygame` library, which can handle keyboard input and play sounds. Below is a simple example of how you can implement this functionality:

1. Make sure you have `pygame` installed. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

2. Use the following code to play a dog barking sound when the space bar is pressed:

```python
import pygame
import sys

# Initialize pygame
pygame.init()

# Set up the display
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((400, 300))
pygame.display.set_caption('Dog Bark Sound Player')

# Load the sound
bark_sound = pygame.mixer.Sound('dog_bark.wav')  # Make sure you have a dog_bark.wav file in the same directory

# Main loop
running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:  # Check if space bar is pressed
                bark_sound.play()  # Play the dog barking sound

# Quit pygame
pygame.quit()
sys.exit()
```

### Note:
- Replace `'dog_bark.wav'` with the path to your dog barking sound file.
- Ensure the sound file is in the correct format (WAV is preferred) and located in the same directory as your script or provide the full path to the file.

This code creates a simple window, and when you press the space bar, it plays the sound of a dog barking.
